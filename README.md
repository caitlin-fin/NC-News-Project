# NC News API

## Setup

To connect to the test and development databases locally create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. Add PGDATABSE=<database_name_here> into each with nc_news and nc_news_test as database names respectively.

This backend API was created for an individual project as part of the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. Please note this is a work in progress and updates will be made regulary.
